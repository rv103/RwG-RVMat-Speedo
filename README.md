# RwG RVMat Speedo
A program to quickly create damaged and destroyed rvmats via DragnDrop

This allows you to easily create the *_damaged and *_destruct.rvmat's.
Drag your original *.rvmat over the respective field (hover feedback) and release it. Now a new *.rvmat with the respective prefix _worn, _damage or _destruct is created in the same folder.
You also have the option of replacing the _nohq, _ smdi or _as with the standard color values by clicking on the respective checkbox.
